Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code** solutions!  
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place every December, offering a series of fun and thought-provoking puzzles. This repository contains my personal solutions, showcasing my progress over the years.

## Repository Highlights
- Each year's solutions are organized into separate directories for clarity and accessibility.
- Solutions are written mainly in [Python](https://github.com/TheoHorn/advent-of-code), but you could find some funny ones (Java, C,e tc.).  
- This repository will be updated as I tackle new challenges and complete more puzzles.
